# wgsl_live
This is a system for live coding fragment shaders using WGSL / WebGPU. Current features include:

- Live video textures and FFT audio analysis
- Back buffer support
- Convenience functions for accessing video / back buffer
- A variety of constants
- Noise functions

This environment is inspired by Shawn Lawson's fantastic environment [The Force](https://github.com/shawnlawson/The_Force/). The goal is for this to serve as 
a similar project for WGSL instead of OpenGL/GLSL.
